            <p>I have been involved in decorating since I bought my first house in 2001 at the age of 18.  While my friends were planning study or travel options, I was going to house inspections in my school uniform and agonising over the perfect paint colour.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>During the next decade, I studied Hospitality Management, obtained a Bachelor of Economics and a Graduate Diploma in Education. I worked in Economic Development, travelled, lived abroad, and settled back in Hobart working as a Maths and Business Teacher.</p>
            <br><br>
<p>It was on my way home from the airport that I purchased my second property and I spent the next 5 years restoring, renovating and styling my 1920s cottage.</p>
<br><br>
<p>But it wasn't until turning 30 and suffering from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome that I re-assessed my priorities and the penny finally dropped – I wanted to spend my time doing something I really loved – helping people, creating, and seeing projects come to fruition without a web of bureaucracy and red tape. Since then, I have bought a seaside apartment and am rebuilding a much more peaceful, productive and prioritised lifestyle.</p>
